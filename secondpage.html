                    <p id="firstpara">Born in 1953 to a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader, Xi Jinping worked his way up the party ranks to become a major player in the Chinese Politburo. By 2013, Xi was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party, Chair of the Military Commission and President of the People’s Republic of China. Although he earned criticism for human rights violations and disruptive economic regulations, Xi also continued the country's rise as a global superpower. His name and philosophy was added to the party constitution in 2017, and the following year he successfully pushed for the abolition of presidential term limits.</p>

Gates grew up in an upper-middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H.

She was an athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership.</p>

                    <p id="firstpara">Born August 31, 1985, Mohammed bin Salman is the eldest child of Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and his third wife, Fahda bint Falah bin Sultan bin Hathleen al-Ajmi, the daughter of the head of a powerful Arabian tribe, known as the Al Ajman. Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was the son of Ibn Saud, the founder of the first king of Saudi Arabia. Salman bin Abdulaziz was the governor of Riyadh province for more than 50 years, until stepping down in 2011. During his tenure, he earned a reputation as an efficient, if harsh, administrator.</p>
                    <p id="parapart1"><span>Education: </span>Graduated from King Saud University with a degree in law</p>
                    <p id="parapart2">In November 2017, Al Saud led an 'anticorruption campaign' that caused many prominent Saudis to be arrested and forced to turn over their fortunes.</p>
                    <p id="parapart3">As a result of the campaign, ten Saudi billionaires were dropped from Forbes' annual list of the world's billionaires.</p>

                    <p id="parapart5">Salman challenged the religious status quo in Saudi Arabia — to some extent. The Saudi royal family has long ruled the kingdom in concert with ultra-conservative Wahhabism clerics, who have been accused of funding and supporting radical extremists and preventing social reforms.</p>

                    <p id="firstpara">Narendra Modi was born in the small town of Vadnagar, in northern Gujarat, India. His father was a street merchant who struggled to support the family. Young Narendra and his brother sold tea near a bus terminal to help out. Though an average student in school, Modi spent hours in the library and was known as a strong debater. In his early teens, he joined Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist political party.</p>
                    <p id="parapart1"><span>Education: </span>Master of Arts, Gujarat University; Bachelor of Arts/Science, Delhi University</p>
                    <p id="parapart2">On May 26, 2014, Modi was sworn in as the 14th prime minister of India, the first to have been born after the country achieved independence from the U.K.</p>
                    <p id="parapart3">In November 2016 he unexpectedly announced plans to eliminate India's two largest banknotes in a bid to reduce money laundering and corruption.</p>
